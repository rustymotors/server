/**
 * An array of message handlers for processing different types of messages.
 * Each handler is associated with an operation code (opCode) and a name.
 * 
 * @type {Array<{opCode: number, name: string, handler: function}>}
 * 
 * @property {number} opCode - The operation code that identifies the type of message.
 * @property {string} name - The name of the message handler.
 * @property {function} handler - The function that processes the message. It takes an object with the following properties:
 * @property {string} handler.args.connectionId - The ID of the connection.
 * @property {GamePacket} handler.args.message - The message to be processed.
 * @property {ServerLogger} handler.args.log - The logger for server logging.
 * @returns {Promise<{connectionId: string, messages: GamePacket[]}>} - A promise that resolves to an object containing the connection ID and an array of messages.
