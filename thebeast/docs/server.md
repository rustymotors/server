# Installing and running the server

This assumes you know the basics of checking out a git repo. If you don't, please search it.

## Requirements

-   Linux
    \*\* If you want to try running on Windows it may work, but I'm not going to support it
-   NodeJS
-   [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (A way to see the logs of the node pod would be very helpful if you need to file a bug report)

### Configure server settings

-   Set the `EXTERNAL_HOST` enviroment variable in docker-compose.yaml to the external hostname or IP address of the machine the server is running on

-   Generate the SSL cert and keys using `make certs`

## Installing

-   `npm install`

### Ports

You will need to open the following ports:

-   80
-   443
-   6660
-   7003
-   8226
-   8227
-   8228
-   43200
-   43300
-   43400
-   53303
-   9000 - 9014 (not yet used, I think they are for UDP client racing

### Running

-   `make prod_node`

This will start the server cluster which involves the database, SSL gateway, and server(s)
